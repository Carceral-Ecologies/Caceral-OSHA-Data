This readme file describes the folders in the raw_data folder.

1. The OSHA_inspections folder includes inspection data downloaded from OSHA. Because the files are so large there are 5 inspection csv files in here that are later merged together into one inspection dataset.
2. The OSHA_related_activity folder includes related activity data downloaded from OSHA. Again multiple files have to be merged into one dataset.
3. The OSHA_violation_event folder includes violation event data downloaded from OSHA. Again multiple files have to be merged into one dataset.
4. The OSHA_violations folder includes violation data downloaded from OSHA. Again multiple files have to be merged into one dataset.
5. The Prisons folder includes prison boundary data for the US from the HIFLD or homeland infrastructure foundation-level data downloaded Nov 2020. https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2d6109d4127d458eaf0958e4c5296b67_0. This data was used for cleaning the facility names.
